# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

What I have created is a prework study guide using CSS, HTML and JavaScript to help me learn and jot down information I will learn in this bootcamp and in the prewrork. It helps me keep all the information I write down into a webpage to acess anytime so I do not need a book or a seperate computer to view whats in my study guide. I learned alot with HTML that I havent previously learned like headers and footers.
